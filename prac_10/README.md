# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At first, my time estimates were not accurate. Usually, the tasks took longer than I expected. I think I spent more time because I kept debugging and tried to write better code.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I continued working on the assignments, I started to understand the workflow better and was able to make more accurate time estimates. Reviewing previous assignments and reading my friends’ code reviews helped me improve and prepare better for the next tasks.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that it’s important to plan the code and divide time before starting the work. I realized that breaking down a big problem into smaller parts makes it easier to understand and helps me solve it more smoothly.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Through the feedback from others, I was able to notice mistakes I didn’t realize before and learned what I needed to improve and fix. It also made me pay more attention to code style and readability.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By seeing different approaches that I hadn’t thought of, I learned various coding styles different from mine. Through reviewing others’ code, I got ideas about what I could learn and try in the future.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[prac_06](https://github.com/myoungseo/cp1404-practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

This review suggested adding the definition of the arguments (name, year, cost) in the function’s docstring to make the code easier to understand. Although it was a simple suggestion, it reminded me of the importance of documentation and gave a helpful direction for making the code more readable and usable for others.

### Good Code Review 2

[prac_07](https://github.com/myoungseo/cp1404-practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

This review was helpful because it suggested replacing the magic number 50 with a constant VINTAGE_THRESHOLD, which improves the readability and maintainability of the code. The reviewer also recommended adding argument descriptions to the docstring, making the function easier to understand. These clear and specific suggestions were very useful and showed attention to both code quality and documentation.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

In the first few weeks, it would be helpful to provide more basic examples or practice problems, as it can be difficult to grasp the concepts in the beginning. I also think it would be great to include mentoring sessions during class time. Assigning one or two students with a strong understanding of programming to each group could encourage peer support, helping others to solve difficult or unclear parts together.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently submitted all the assignments, kept trying to improve, and made an effort to actively apply the feedback I received from code reviews.
